# MS Discovery Batch script

[Lire cette documentation en fran√ßais](/README.fr.md).

This batch script retrieves information about the technical configuration and software installed on the server on which it is run, in order to perform software license compliance analysis for *Microsoft* server products such as *Windows Server* and *SQL Server*. It works only on servers with *Windows* as operating system. Finally, it allows to send the results to an FTP server to centralize the information retrieved on each server.

## Usage

* Download the `discovery.bat` script to a folder on the target server.
* Adjust the configuration if necessary as detailed below.
* Run the `discovery.bat` script, e.g. from the command line, with administrator privileges. 
* Information obtained by the script are written to a text file named `hostname.domain_year_month_day-hours_minutes_seconds.txt`.
* If the `FTP_UPLOAD` configuration parameter is set to `1`, the text file is sent to the FTP server and destroyed locally.

## Configuration

It is possible to adjust the configuration either directly in the main `discovery.bat` script, or by creating a `config.bat` file (to be placed in the same directory) according to the templates provided in `config.test.bat` (for local testing) or `config.example.bat` (for sending to an FTP server). The configuration allows you to adjust the output folder of the script, and the login credentials for the FTP server to which the results are to be sent.

**Warning** : The script uses the native *Windows* FTP client [ftp.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/ftp). This client allows only active FTP connections; see [this explanation](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ftp_modes) and [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32226143/failed-to-ftp-upload-using-windows-ftp-exe-port-ip-is-not-same-as-nnn-nnn-nnn). Therefore, sending to an FTP server will only work if the server running the script is able to access the FTP server in active FTP mode. Firewalls and intermediate networks can prevent this. 

## Output format

The format of the text file obtained at the output of the script is as follows:

The *MAC addresses*, *Installed products* and *SQL Server instances* sections contain as many lines as necessary, in CSV format. If no address, product or instance is found, only the attributes line is present.

In addition to the general server information contained in the first section, MAC addresses can be used to identify the machine (physical or virtual). The list of installed products is filtered to contain only the products edited by *Microsoft*.
